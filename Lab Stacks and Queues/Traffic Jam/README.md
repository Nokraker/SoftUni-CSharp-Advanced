#Име Traffic Jam
#Условие
Create a program that simulates the queue that forms during a traffic jam. During a traffic jam, only N cars can pass
the crossroads when the light goes green. Then the program reads the vehicles that arrive one by one and adds
them to the queue. When the light goes green N number of cars pass the crossroads and for each, a message
"{car} passed!" is displayed. When the "end" command is given, terminate the program and display a message
with the total number of cars that passed the crossroads.
